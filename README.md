- Update task: `cli-task-tracker update <taskId> <description>`
- Delete task: `cli-task-tracker delete <taskIid>`
- List tasks: `cli-task-tracker list [todo|in-progress|done]`

âœ¨ The main goal of this project was to practice C# coding, SOLID notions, and file management. I took the idea, as part of the back end software development path, from: https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker
